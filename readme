# Telco Athena Layered Architecture Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to refactor a messy monolithic SQL script into a clean, modular layered architecture in AWS Athena (or any SQL engine that supports views).

We simulate a Telco dataset with:
- **Raw Layer**: Customers, Subscriptions, Network Usage, Payments
- **Silver Layer**: Standardization, cleaning, deduplication, validation
- **Gold Layer**: Star schema with dimensions and fact tables ready for BI tools
